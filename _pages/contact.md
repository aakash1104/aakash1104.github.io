I can be reached through several platforms:

<a href="mailto:aakprabhu@ucdavis.edu">
<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;"
src="../../assets/img/logos/email.png" 
width="100" />
</a>
I can be reached best at <code>aakprabhu [at] ucdavis [dot] edu </code>. 
You'll find that I'm quite fast at responding to emails! Contacting me through
email is probably your best way to reach me. If you think it's strange that
I didn't use the "@" and "." while giving out my email, then you might want to

I check LinkedIn messages frequently. If you're trying to connect with me on 
LinkedIn, please add a note especially if we do not know each other personally.

I check twitter a lot but am only slowly building my online presence there. I
hope to start tweeting more often about all things tech, computer science, life!

Some of my side projects, including this website, are hosted on 
github. Feel free to contribute to anything by opening an issue or submitting
a pull request. My <a href="https://github.com/aakash1104/Graph-Algorithms"> most popular</a> 
github repo is a crash course on graph algorithms to prepare you for technical 
interviews.
