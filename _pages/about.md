## about 🤔 

I am a software engineer at [Flexport](https://flexport.com). I graduated with a
Master's degree in Computer Science from UC Davis in 2021. I also got my
Bachelor's degree here in 2019.


**Previously, I...** 🤷
* was a software engineering intern at [Intel](https://intel.com) working on
  performance optimization.
* was a software engineering intern at [LendingClub](https://lendingclub.com)
* co-founded the [CERD](https://cerd.cs.ucdavis.edu) seminar at UC 
Davis: a weekly seminar that broadly focuses on computing education 
* designed a brand new open sourced seminar class (titled the _Missing CS
   Class_) on UNIX tools, interacting with the command line, effective debugging
and testing strategies, and shell scripting

## informal ##
* I spend too much time on 
[r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/) and 
[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)
* I love a good cup of [masala chai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai)
more than anything else (_please don't call chai tea latte authentic_)
* I'm a sucker for a good mystery thriller movie/TV series
* Sudoku has always fascinated me. Solve some puzzles [here](https://sudoku.com)
* Over the weekends, I hike and explore the beautiful trails that California has
      to offer.
