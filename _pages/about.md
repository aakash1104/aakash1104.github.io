## about
Hi there! I'm currently a second year computer science graduate student at 
[UC Davis](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu). I also got my bachelor's degree here in
2019! Currently, I'm a software engineering intern at [Intel](https://intel.com)'s
Client Compute Group (CCG) working on performance optimization.

**What's next?** 🤔 

In the summer of 2021, I will be joining [Flexport](https://flexport.com) (at
their HQ in San Francisco) as a  full time software engineer helping global 
trade be as easy as clicking a button.

**Previously, I...** 🤷
* was a software engineering intern at [LendingClub](https://lendingclub.com)
* co-founded the [CERD](https://cerd.cs.ucdavis.edu) seminar at UC 
Davis: a weekly seminar that broadly focuses on computing education 
* designed a brand new open sourced seminar class (titled the _Missing CS
   Class_) on UNIX tools, interacting with the command line, effective debugging
and testing strategies, and shell scripting

## informal ##
* I spend too much time on 
[r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/) and 
[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)
* I love a good cup of [masala chai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai)
more than anything else (_please don't call chai tea latte authentic_)
* I'm a sucker for a good mystery thriller movie/TV series
* Sudoku has always fascinated me. Solve some puzzles [here](https://sudoku.com)
* Over the weekends, I hike and explore the beautiful trails that California has
      to offer.
